## Documentation and Resources for Proof General

Proof General has a FAQ and two manuals, and places for users:

{% comment %} TODO: convert FAQ to Markdown within the main PG repo {% endcomment %}
-   [FAQ](https://github.com/ProofGeneral/PG/blob/master/FAQ)
-   [Proof General user manual](http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/userman)
-   [Adapting Proof General manual](http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/adaptingman)
-   [Proof General Wiki](http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki)
-   [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ProofGeneral/PG/issues)
-   [Trac bug tracker](http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/trac) (legacy bug tracking system)
-   [Users mailing list](http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/mailinglist) (announcements only)

The Adapting manual gives instructions on how to adapt Proof General to
new proof systems, it's not needed for ordinary use. For printing you
can download:

-   [User manual (pdf)](http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/releases/ProofGeneral/doc/ProofGeneral.pdf)
    (627k),
-   [Adapting manual (pdf)](http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/releases/ProofGeneral/doc/PG-adapting.pdf) (507k)

{% comment %} TODO: update
Both manuals are included in the [download](/download) (in HTML and Info
formats) and available in Info format from inside Proof General. For the
CVS or a development version of Proof General, see the [development download](devel).
{% endcomment %}

See also the [publications page](pubs) for academic pointers.

## Manuals for Emacs

If you're new to Emacs, it's recommended to try the Emacs tutorial,
available inside Emacs by pressing **C-h t** (which means
`ctrl`-with-`h` followed by `t`). There are many other **C-h** commands,
and the Help menu inside Emacs gives access to more help facilities.

For on-line reading and further help, these links might be helpful:

-   The [Emacs user manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/)
-   The [Emacs lisp introduction](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/)
    and [Emacs lisp reference](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/elisp-manual/).
-   The [Emacs Wiki](http://www.emacswiki.org)

You don't need to look at anything about lisp unless you're interested
in developing Proof General.
