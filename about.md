## About the Proof General project

The forefather of Proof General was LEGO mode, begun in 1994 at the
[LFCS](http://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs/) by Thomas Kleymann. LEGO
mode was an Emacs-based front end for LEGO similar to David Aspinall's
[Isamode](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/da/Isamode), developed at the
LFCS since 1992. After 1994, implementations of proof-by-pointing and
script management were added to LEGO mode, and the code was made
generic. The generic basis was developed by Thomas Kleymann, Dilip
Sequeira, Healfdene Goguen and David Aspinall. The current authors and
maintainers of the various instantiations of Proof General are mentioned
on the [front page](/) and in the [AUTHORS](/AUTHORS) file.

The Proof General project was coordinated until October 1998 by Thomas
Kleymann, and since then by David Aspinall. The project has benefited
from travel and auxiliary support funding by
[EPSRC](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/E005713/1),
the [EC](http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/research/types-bra/index.html),
and the [LFCS](http://www.lfcs.informatics.ed.ac.uk).

David Aspinall designed the web pages and graphics for Proof General.
